The Terraform code at ocp4-upi-powervs is used for the deployment process. Ensure your PowerVS instance is prepped for deploying OpenShift Clusters. Please check this link for more details Here is quick demo . Features Simple script based installer to deploy OpenShift (4.5 onwards) cluster on PowerVS leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pattern Supports multiple (64-bit) x86 platforms including Linux, Windows & Mac OSX Sets up the latest IBM Cloud CLI with Power Virtual Servers plugin. Sets up the latest Terraform binary Provides interactive mode to populate required Terraform variables Abstract out the Terraform lifecycle management Supported Platforms Only 64bit Operating Systems are supported by the script. The script requires bash shell and a package manager pre-configured. MacOS Catalina (10.15) and above is required. The script uses Homebrew package manager to install required packages. Linux (x86_64) RHEL8/CentOS8 and above or Ubuntu 16.04 and above is required. The script uses the default package manager ( yum/dnf/apt ) based on the distribution. Windows 10 (64-bit) The script can run on GitBash, Windows Subsystem for Linux and Cygwin terminals. If using Cygwin, then please ensure curl and unzip packages are installed. You will need to run the Cygwin setup again. Note: PowerShell is Unsupported . Firewall Requirements Ensure inbound access is allowed for the following TCP ports. This is only required when using a Cloud instance or a remote VM so that you can connect to it using SSH and run the installer 22 (SSH) Ensure outbound access is allowed for the following TCP ports 80 (HTTP) 443 (HTTPS) 6443 (OC CLI) Usage Create an install directory where all the configurations, logs and data files will be stored. $ mkdir ocp-install-dir && cd ocp-install-dir Download the script on your system and change the permission to execute. $ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocp-power-automation/openshift-install-power/master/openshift-install-powervs -o ./openshift-install-powervs $ chmod +x ./openshift-install-powervs Run the script. $ ./openshift-install-powervs Automation for deploying OpenShift 4.X on PowerVS Usage: openshift-install-powervs [command] [<args> [<value>]] Available commands: setup Install all the required packages/binaries in current directory variables Interactive way to populate the variables file create Create an OpenShift cluster destroy Destroy an OpenShift cluster output Display the cluster information.

In case you missed, here is the link to the prerequisites For running the script you need the following: 1. IBM Cloud API key : Create the key by following the instructions available in the following link 2. OpenShift Pull secret : Download the secret from the following link . You'll need to place the file in the install directory and name it as pull-secret.txt 3. RHEL Subscription ID and Password . Quickstart Export the IBM Cloud API Key and RHEL Subscription Password. $ set +o history $ export IBMCLOUD_API_KEY='<your API key>' $ export RHEL_SUBS_PASSWORD='<your RHEL subscription password>' $ set -o history Run the create command. $ ./openshift-install-powervs create The script will setup the required tools and run in interactive mode prompting for inputs. Once the above command completes successfully it will print the cluster access information. ``` Login to bastion: 'ssh -i automation/data/id_rsa root@145.48.43.53' and start using the 'oc' command. To access the cluster on local system when using 'oc' run: 'export KUBECONFIG=/root/ocp-install-dir/automation/kubeconfig' Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.test-ocp-6f2c.ibm.com Login to the console with user: \"kubeadmin\", and password: \"MHvmI-z5nY8-CBFKF-hmCDJ\" Add the line on local system 'hosts' file: 145.48.43.53 api.test-ocp-6f2c.ibm.com console-openshift-console.apps.test-ocp-6f2c.ibm.com integrated-oauth-server-openshift-authentication.apps.test-ocp-6f2c.ibm.com oauth-openshift.apps.test-ocp-6f2c.ibm.com prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps.test-ocp-6f2c.ibm.com grafana-openshift-monitoring.apps.test-ocp-6f2c.ibm.com example.apps.test-ocp-6f2c.ibm.com ``` Advanced Usage Before running the script, you may choose to override some environment variables as per your requirement. Different OpenShift Versions By default OpenShift version 4.6 is installed. If you want to install 4.5, then export the following variables RELEASE_VER : Default is 4.6 $ export RELEASE_VER=\"4.5\" ARTIFACTS_VERSION : Tag/Branch (eg: release-4.6, v4.5.1, master) of ocp4-upi-powervs repository. Default is \"release- \". $ export ARTIFACTS_VERSION=\"release-4.5\" Non-interactive mode You can avoid the interactive mode by having the required input files available in the install directory Required input files 1. Terraform vars file (filename: var.tfvars ) 2. SSH key files (filename: id_rsa & id_rsa.pub ) Example `var.tfvars` file ``` ibmcloud_region = \"syd\" ibmcloud_zone = \"syd04\" service_instance_id = \"123456abc-xzz-2223434343\" rhel_image_name = \"rhel-83-12082020\" rhcos_image_name = \"rhcos-46-09182020\" network_name = \"ocp-net\" openshift_install_tarball = \"https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/ppc64le/clients/ocp/stable-4.6/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz\" openshift_client_tarball = \"https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/ppc64le/clients/ocp/stable-4.6/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz\" cluster_id_prefix = \"test-ocp\" cluster_domain = \"xip.io\" storage_type = \"nfs\" volume_size = \"300\" bastion = {memory = \"16\", processors = \"1\", \"count\" = 1} bootstrap = {memory = \"32\", processors = \"0.5\", \"count\" = 1} master = {memory = \"32\", processors = \"0.5\", \"count\" = 3} worker = {memory = \"32\", processors = \"0.5\", \"count\" = 2} rhel_subscription_username = \"mysubscription@email.com\" rhel_subscription_password = \"mysubscriptionPassword\" ``` You can also pass a custom Terraform variables file using the option `-var-file <filename>` to the script. You can also use the option `-var \"key=value\"` to pass a single variable. If the same variable is given more than once then precedence will be from left (low) to right (high).
